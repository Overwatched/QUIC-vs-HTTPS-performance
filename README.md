# QUIC-vs-HTTPS-performance
This is an small assignment that compares QUIC (and HTTP) vs the HTTPS stack (TCP+TLS+HTTP) in a rather unorthodox manor. It does not make use of the QUIC client and server, but instead attempts to use live websites (e.g youtube.com) that has QUIC and HTTPS enabled.

## Here are some images of the result
